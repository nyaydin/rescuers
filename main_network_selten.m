% Main_network_selten: 
% a network is created with two different sets of weights (the time weights
% and the distance weights)--> the "time network" and the "distance network". The shortest path is evaluated for the time
% network and the distance network. Then the Selten agent based model is
% run, the stategies are: 1) choose the shortest time path to reach a node, 2)
% choose the shortest distance path to reach a node, 3) direct strategy,
% 4)contrarian strategy.
